# Weather Prediction Project
This project provides current weather information and predicts future temperature and humidity based on historical data.

# Features
Get current weather data for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API.
Read and process historical weather data from a CSV file.
Predict the likelihood of rain using a Random Forest Classifier.
Predict future temperature and humidity using a Random Forest Regressor.
Display current weather details and future predictions.
# Setup
Clone the repository.
Install the required Python packages: requests, pandas, numpy, sklearn, datetime, pytz.
Obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap.
Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' in the code with your actual API key.
Make sure you have a weather.csv file with historical weather data in the same directory as the script.
